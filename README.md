# Luxury Haven Hotel Website

This project is a modern, responsive, and elegant website for a luxury hotel. It's designed to showcase the hotel's amenities, rooms, and services with a polished and user-friendly interface. The website features smooth scroll animations, a dynamic booking modal, and is built with a mobile-first approach.

### Key Features

* **Interactive Booking Modal:** A non-intrusive modal for guests to check-in and check-out dates and room types.

* **Smooth Scroll Animations:** Elements fade in and slide up or sideways as the user scrolls down the page, creating an engaging visual experience.

* **Clean & Elegant UI:** A sophisticated design with a focus on clear typography and a balanced color palette.

* **Sticky Navigation Bar:** A navigation bar that stays at the top of the viewport for easy access to different sections of the website.

* **Image Gallery:** A dedicated section to showcase the hotel's photography.

### Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For the website's core structure and content.

* **CSS:** For custom styling and responsive design.

* **JavaScript:** To handle all interactive features, including the mobile menu, booking modal, and scroll animations.

* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid and consistent styling.

* **Google Fonts:** Used for elegant typography, specifically `Playfair Display` and `Inter`.

* **Font Awesome:** For scalable vector icons used throughout the site.

### How to Run the Website

This is a static website, so it's very easy to run. You do not need any special tools or servers.

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.

2.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

### Customization

You can easily customize the website by editing the HTML and CSS:

* **Content:** Edit the text in the HTML file to change headings, paragraphs, and descriptions.

* **Colors & Fonts:** Modify the Tailwind CSS classes or the custom CSS at the top of the file to change the color scheme or font families.

### Potential Improvements

* Implement a server-side booking system to handle real-time room availability.

* Add a testimonial or guest review section.

* Integrate a dynamic map to show the hotel's location.

* Optimize images for faster loading times.
